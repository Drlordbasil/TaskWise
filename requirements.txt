To generate the `requirements.txt` file for the Python program you provided, we need to identify the required Python packages used in the code. Here are the identified package requirements:

```
datetime
random
smtplib
email
```

Please note that the `email` package is a standard library package and does not need to be installed separately.

You can create a `requirements.txt` file with the above package requirements and specify the versions if needed. Here is an example `requirements.txt` file:

```
datetime
random
smtplib
```
